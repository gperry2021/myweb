				<h3>
					The reason why they are important to me
				</h3>
				<p>They are important to me because they helped me grow as a person. Mi familia was always there for me
				doesn't matter what happend they was there from thick to thin. Mi familia deserves more credit then needed
				we may made fun of each other but that is how it is. my tio daniel gonzalez saved me from being drowned in
				south padre island when I was 8 years old. my brother was always there when someone wanted to dis on me. 
				my mom was always there as well so that is why they are important to me.</p>

				<h3>
					The reason why I want them
				</h3>
				<p>I want to grow up and look at all the stuff I did as a kid and be 
				proud that I did the stuff that I did. I would love to go and vist 
				diffrent places and explore diffrent cultures. I would love to get 
				a good paying job that I would enjoy insted of going to a job that 
				pays good but I dislike. I would love to learn more spanish then I 
				do so I can go see my cousins, tios, tias and talk spanish so I don't 
				feel left out. I would love to make music because I listen to it so much
				that it would be great if I could make songs that would go viral.</p>

					The reason why they are important
				</h3>
				<p>People that I can blindly trust is mostly all of my friends I have never ran into 
				someone who would snitch because I do not like to group with people like that not 
				trust worthy if you ask me. My mom, dad, bro they all have respect and my mom 
				taught me alot of things to not say and such but there is times where the rules 
				gotta be broken. My family taught me alot so I trust them with my life that is 
				how I feel.</p>

				<h3>
					The games I like
				</h3>
				<p>The reason why I like these games is because spyro was my first game ever I played it on the ps2
				I was a really great game. Skyrim is the best rpg I have ever heard of it tied it with my like for 
				knights and dragons is the best game if you ask me. Call of duty is a classic just multiplayer is 
				very toxic if you are little they like to talk mad smack. Red dead is a really fun cowboy game 
				where they run because they are outlaws. Fallout is also a very fun rpg.</p>

				<h3>
					The Rappers I like
				</h3>
				<p>Juice wrld is a freestyle rap/ hip-hop type of music it is not ment 
				for sensitive ears. xxxtentaction is a hype and sad type of music a vibe basiclly.
				Lil uzi spits bars really fast and does not play around when he raps.
				Ski mask the slump god is really fast rapper he means his words. Trippie Redd 
				its a rockstar type of rap music he made good songs back then but not really now.</p>

				<h3>
					The Apps I like
				</h3>
				<p>Discord is one of my main used social apps because I run a server and just chat with others. 
				snapchat is a secondary type of socialmedia for me because I don't really talk that much on it. 
				Facebook is what my family mostly use I only use it for events and advertising that kind of stuff. 
				Instagram is the same thing as facebook it is not really what I use but if I need to.</p>
