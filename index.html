				<h3>
					The games I like
				</h3>
				<p>The reason why I like all of these games is because they helped me grow
				and think about other things to doe insted of just one thing to do like in skyrim
				where you have side quests you don't need to just do the main story it's about
				what you want to do. Spyro around with the playstation 2 and playstation 1 so it
				semi bad graphics but I didn't care it was fun. Call of duty I was introducted by
				brother so we got closer becasue of call of duty even though I was bad at it
				but it was ok if you ask me. Fortnite was one of the games you lowkey liked but
				raged alot I played since season 1 and quit at season 6 trough 8 then joined back
				kinda sad I missed the seasons battle pass just didn't have money to buy it so that
				was that. Fallot is one of thoese old games that bring you back into old music but is
				a very fun roleplaying game without any questions.</p>

				<h3>
					The Rappers I like
				</h3>
				<p>The reason why I like Juice WRLD is he has helped me trough heart break and his music is up rythm
				so the vibe never dies and he keeps true to his fans but sadly he passed away in chicago on december 8th 2019
				he has made a lot of music to inspire people and help people trough issues. XXXTENTACTION has made hype
				and sad music but he also died at a dirtbike shop at flordia on 2018 they both died before 21. Lil Uzi Vert
				has made dance music and party music he is a small dude still popping off at the rap world. Tupac was story telling
				rapper he is a good pick to listen to for some oldies vibes. B.I.G Had upbeat music and it took rap high up
				in the music community he was a freestyler and did great. Trippie Redd is off soundcloud who rode off Juice WRLD
				XXXTENTACTION and Skimask the slump god's fame he raps about sad music but only cares for money. SkiMaskTheSlumpGod
				is a really fast rapper who spits fast and freestyles.</p>
